Auto reviewer and Cars and Bids auction platform founder Doug DeMuro points to Tesla's disappointing pipeline of new vehicle announcements and the lack of updates to its existing lineup. ""Tesla hasn't really shown us anything like they used to, where they can just drop something and wow everybody and stay years ahead,"" says DeMuro to Yahoo! Finance Live. The competition among automakers for EV buyers has intensified recently, with entries from new companies like Rivian (RIVN) aiming for the pickup and rugged truck market, and industry stalwarts like Ford (F), Volkswagen (VOW3.DE), and General Motors (GM) offering vehicles like the GMC Hummer EV. DeMuro says the competition has eroded Tesla's first-mover advantage, with some of the blame attributed to Tesla's lack of new updates in nearly a decade. DeMuro points to Tesla's pickup as one example. ""The cybertruck, which has been touted and vaunted for years, is late,"" he says. ""Rivian is already out with a pickup, General Motors is out with a pickup, Ford has the lightning."" When Tesla introduced new vehicles, ""It was so far ahead of everybody else that you couldn't catch up to Tesla,"" says DeMuro. ""In the ensuing 10 years, people have caught up to Tesla.""

Auto reviewer and Cars and Bids auction platform founder Doug DeMuro points to Tesla's disappointing pipeline of new vehicle announcements and the lack of updates to its existing lineup. ""Tesla hasn't really shown us anything like they used to, where they can just drop something and wow everybody and stay years ahead,"" says DeMuro to Yahoo! Finance Live. The competition among automakers for EV buyers has intensified recently, with entries from new companies like Rivian (RIVN) aiming for the pickup and rugged truck market, and industry stalwarts like Ford (F), Volkswagen (VOW3.DE), and General Motors (GM) offering vehicles like the GMC Hummer EV. DeMuro says the competition has eroded Tesla's first-mover advantage, with some of the blame attributed to Tesla's lack of new updates in nearly a decade. DeMuro points to Tesla's pickup as one example. ""The cybertruck, which has been touted and vaunted for years, is late,"" he says. ""Rivian is already out with a pickup, General Motors is out with a pickup, Ford has the lightning."" When Tesla introduced new vehicles, ""It was so far ahead of everybody else that you couldn't catch up to Tesla,"" says DeMuro. ""In the ensuing 10 years, people have caught up to Tesla."" Above, Yahoo! Finance's Pras Subramanian and Brian Sozzi spoke to DeMuro.

Yahoo Finance is here to help with a team of experts providing their advice on Tesla stock performance, price cuts, Ford's EV plan, competition in the EV market, and more. Tesla stock volatility S3 Partners Head of Predictive Analytics Ihor Dusaniwsky told Yahoo Finance that ""short sellers like the volatility because they can get a big bang for their buck."" Tesla valuation ROTH Capital Partners Senior Research Analyst Craig Irwin thinks that ""there are a lot of other companies that are going to be successful here too, and the valuation is egregious.""

Ford's EV plan ""Ford is all in on electrification,"" said Ford Model E VP of Electric Vehicle Programs Darren Palmer. ""We are, of course, monitoring the situation for pricing, and we will adjust how the market sees fit."" Full video transcript: Ihor Dusaniwsky (00:00:05 -> 00:00:28) - It's a tech stock that's kind of a bellwether for the group. So it's got huge volatility, short sellers like the volatility because they can get a big bang for their buck when the stock goes up or down. So when you see these huge losses, you'll see people getting squeezed in the stock and short sellers will cover. The thing with Tesla that's interesting is that when one person gets out, another person gets in. It's kinda like the WWE, keep getting tagged in. Craig Irwin (00:00:28 -> 00:00:51) - It's a great company, great products, love the fact that they pioneered this market, but there are a lot of other companies that are gonna be successful here too. And the valuation is egregious. EVs are inevitable. There's gonna be a lot of companies that are successful. There are going to be a lot of companies in the supply chain, either on the battery side or the component side that are going to be successful. I just don't think Tesla is the one to invest in here. I think there are other great names. Darren Palmer (00:00:52 -> 00:01:12) - Ford is all in on electrification. We are seeing massive demand for our products. So we had to invest a lot of money to increase the production and at the moment we are completely sold out of all of the vehicles. We are of course monitoring the situation for dynamics for pricing, and we will adjust as the market sees fit and how our customers value our products. Tom Narayan (00:01:12 -> 00:01:27) - So I think Tesla is just being the first one out the gates to cut pricing. Remember pricing went up a lot in 2022. Tesla has the ability to cut pricing, and I actually think that other automakers are inevitably gonna have to follow suit.

First quarter sales of EVs surged 45% from a year ago, according to Kelley Blue Book. EVs now account for 7.2% of total auto sales, according to Cox Automotive. The EV maker with the biggest brand recognition is Tesla (TSLA), but competitors Ford (F) and General Motors (GM) have been catching up. GM's strong first quarter with sales of 20,670 vehicles put the auto maker into the No. 2 spot in the EV race. Ford only sold 10,866 vehicles. Neither caught up to Tesla, which delivered 161,000 vehicles. If you’re interested in buying an EV for the first time, it may seem daunting.

Full video transcript: Ihor Dusaniwsky (00:00:05 -> 00:00:28) - It's a tech stock that's kind of a bellwether for the group. So it's got huge volatility, short sellers like the volatility because they can get a big bang for their buck when the stock goes up or down. So when you see these huge losses, you'll see people getting squeezed in the stock and short sellers will cover. The thing with Tesla that's interesting is that when one person gets out, another person gets in. It's kinda like the WWE, keep getting tagged in. Craig Irwin (00:00:28 -> 00:00:51) - It's a great company, great products, love the fact that they pioneered this market, but there are a lot of other companies that are gonna be successful here too. And the valuation is egregious. EVs are inevitable. There's gonna be a lot of companies that are successful. There are going to be a lot of companies in the supply chain, either on the battery side or the component side that are going to be successful. I just don't think Tesla is the one to invest in here. I think there are other great names. Darren Palmer (00:00:52 -> 00:01:12) - Ford is all in on electrification. We are seeing massive demand for our products. So we had to invest a lot of money to increase the production and at the moment we are completely sold out of all of the vehicles. We are of course monitoring the situation for dynamics for pricing, and we will adjust as the market sees fit and how our customers value our products. Tom Narayan (00:01:12 -> 00:01:27) - So I think Tesla is just being the first one out the gates to cut pricing. Remember pricing went up a lot in 2022. Tesla has the ability to cut pricing, and I actually think that other automakers are inevitably gonna have to follow suit.

First quarter sales of EVs surged 45% from a year ago, according to Kelley Blue Book. EVs now account for 7.2% of total auto sales, according to Cox Automotive. The EV maker with the biggest brand recognition is Tesla (TSLA), but competitors Ford (F) and General Motors (GM) have been catching up. GM's strong first quarter with sales of 20,670 vehicles put the auto maker into the No. 2 spot in the EV race. Ford only sold 10,866 vehicles. Neither caught up to Tesla, which delivered 161,000 vehicles. If you’re interested in buying an EV for the first time, it may seem daunting.

CFO John Lawler told Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman and Brad Smith the company is focused on profitability for its electric offerings, saying ""we are not going to sacrifice profitability just for share in volume"". The comments allude to Tesla's pricing strategy; Elon Musk told investors last month that ""pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice"" after lower prices narrowed margins for the automaker. Despite the comments, Ford unveiled cuts of it own. It's dropping the cost of its Mustang Mach-E by up to $4,000. It also laid out its first quarter earnings by division for the first time. Although the automaker beat overall expectations with strong revenue growth, its EV division revealed a pre-tax loss of $722 million. Ford expects it to turn operating margins positive by 2026. Ford is taking a ""balanced approach"" to EV pricing, Lawler says, making sure any adjustments serve the company well in the long run. When cutting costs, Ford will be ""thoughtful"" to keep that balance. Lawler added that Ford is at an advantage as one of the first movers in the EV space, which will help establish brand loyalty among new EV customers. In his full interview, Lawler dives deeper into Ford's strong first quarter with Brad Smith and Julie Hyman.

CFO John Lawler told Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman and Brad Smith the company is focused on profitability for its electric offerings, saying ""we are not going to sacrifice profitability just for share in volume"". The comments allude to Tesla's pricing strategy; Elon Musk told investors last month that ""pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice"" after lower prices narrowed margins for the automaker. Despite the comments, Ford unveiled cuts of it own. It's dropping the cost of its Mustang Mach-E by up to $4,000. It also laid out its first quarter earnings by division for the first time. Although the automaker beat overall expectations with strong revenue growth, its EV division revealed a pre-tax loss of $722 million. Ford expects it to turn operating margins positive by 2026. Ford is taking a ""balanced approach"" to EV pricing, Lawler says, making sure any adjustments serve the company well in the long run. When cutting costs, Ford will be ""thoughtful"" to keep that balance. Lawler added that Ford is at an advantage as one of the first movers in the EV space, which will help establish brand loyalty among new EV customers.

Tom Narayan, RBC Capital Markets Lead Equity Analyst, Global Autos, discussed how Tesla's (TSLA) self-driving software and its recent deals with Ford (F) and General Motors (GM) could help the company dominate the EV market. Narayan said, ""The deals that they struck with Ford and GM coming to Tesla and choosing their platform ... Elon Musk said we want to be like Android, and really open up this software to everybody.""

Gerber said, ""The market is finally realizing the full value of the software that they've been developing."" Yahoo Finance Senior Business Reporter Ines Ferre discussed Tesla's AI-fueled run. Ferre said, ""Part of this has to do with AI. Adam Jonas over at Morgan Stanley writing a note recently saying that investors are thinking of Tesla first as an AI company and second as an automobile maker.""

Tom Narayan, RBC Capital Markets Lead Equity Analyst of Global Autos, and David Whiston, Morningstar U.S. Autos Equity Analyst, join Yahoo Finance Live to discuss how a potential strike will impact the auto industry. On the potential UAW strike, Whiston says this is the fifth round of contract talks he has experienced, but ""this is the most worried I’ve been about any of them."" Whiston says the UAW's demands are effectively asking for the automakers to ""go back to how things were in the 20th century with everyone having a pension and retiree healthcare."" ""Many of those workers have seen their parents or their grandparents have those benefits, but it’s just not economically feasible anymore,"" Whiston explains. Narayan and Whiston also discuss pricing in the auto industry. Narayan says, ""the big topic really for the carmakers is pricing and price normalization."" Price normalization is ""a bigger threat, I think, to the auto industry than this one-time hit that’ll happen with the strike or financial costs raising somewhat,"" Narayan explains. Narayan notes that with the Inflation Reduction Act, automakers will get more money to produce batteries domestically so ""you’re going to see a lot of price deflation actually, I think, on EVs,"" adding that he thinks ultimately it will be cheaper to buy an EV than a gas-powered car.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=9acd2f07710507a755e81bab67ec095c9459cd3d810b8946290eceee56a53d63,0.0

Tom Narayan, RBC Capital Markets Lead Equity Analyst of Global Autos, and David Whiston, Morningstar U.S. Autos Equity Analyst, join Yahoo Finance Live to discuss how a potential strike will impact the auto industry. On the potential UAW strike, Whiston says this is the fifth round of contract talks he has experienced, but ""this is the most worried I’ve been about any of them."" Whiston says the UAW's demands are effectively asking for the automakers to ""go back to how things were in the 20th century with everyone having a pension and retiree healthcare."" ""Many of those workers have seen their parents or their grandparents have those benefits, but it’s just not economically feasible anymore,"" Whiston explains. Narayan and Whiston also discuss pricing in the auto industry. Narayan says, ""the big topic really for the carmakers is pricing and price normalization."" Price normalization is ""a bigger threat, I think, to the auto industry than this one-time hit that’ll happen with the strike or financial costs raising somewhat,"" Narayan explains. Narayan notes that with the Inflation Reduction Act, automakers will get more money to produce batteries domestically so ""you’re going to see a lot of price deflation actually, I think, on EVs,"" adding that he thinks ultimately it will be cheaper to buy an EV than a gas-powered car.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=9acd2f07710507a755e81bab67ec095c9459cd3d810b8946290eceee56a53d63,0.0

Bomey says, “there’s a possibility of striking all three at the same time” and “if that happens, we would see a serious bottleneck in the auto industry.” Bomey adds, “that Tesla (TSLA) would be the winner if there’s a big strike.” The company would also “be the winner if the automakers have to agree to huge pay increases because, of course, Tesla is not unionized.” Bomey notes that “one big question after this is all over, is… when and will the UAW start to take a crack at organizing Tesla again?” As union membership has declined over the last several years, Madland notes that although the “desire for unions is, sort of, as high now as it’s ever been,” the “law makes its very, very hard for workers to join unions and allows companies lots of tools for union-busting.”",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=db80ebc6d85230fa1a4515e7dac284ffc28a630d8055f2287d763e2f0faf53e4,-0.8316309452056885

Autolist Editor-in-Chief David Undercoffler sits down with Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo, exploring the implications of a targeted strike approach by the United Auto Workers (UAW), its potential consequences on car prices and the used car market, and how this strike could offer advantages to other automakers like Tesla (TSLA).“Seems like Stellantis was the most proactive and most aggressive in building up a supply of vehicles — that's Jeep, that's Dodge, that's Ram vehicles,” Undercoffler says. “Ford and GM… the supply is quite a bit lower, so they're going to feel the impacts of this strike most immediately.”",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=df88b98b69a0c701d0e8d775e4ef3453bc7ee64b2acf17d9bf37f2137541283a,-0.9299165606498718
